 For nineteen years he had lived as one in a dream: he looked without seeing,
 listened without hearing, forgetting everything, almost everything. When he
 fell, he became unconscious; when he came to, the present was almost intolerable
 in its richness and sharpness, as were his most distant and trivial memories.
 Somewhat later he learned that he was paralyzed. The fact scarcely interested
 him. He reasoned (he felt) that his immobility was a minimum price to pay. Now
 his perception and his memory were infallible.
